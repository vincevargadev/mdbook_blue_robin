# Dart Programming Language

Dart is an open-source, general-purpose programming language developed by Google. It is optimized for building web, server, and mobile applications, with a particular focus on front-end development using its rich standard library and productive development environment. Dart supports sound null safety, ensuring variables cannot be null unless explicitly allowed, and compiles to ARM and x64 machine code for fast performance.

## Key Features

- **Optimized for UI**: Designed for creating expressive and flexible UIs.
- **Fast Performance**: Compiles to efficient machine code.
- **Productive Development**: Features a rich standard library and strong tooling support.
- **Sound Null Safety**: Enhances code reliability and robustness.

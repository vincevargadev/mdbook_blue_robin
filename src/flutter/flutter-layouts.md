# Flutter Layouts

Flutter provides a rich set of widgets to create complex layouts for your applications. These widgets enable you to arrange, align, and position your UI elements in a flexible and responsive manner.

## Basic Layout Widgets

- **Container**: A versatile widget for creating rectangular visual elements. It can be customized with padding, margins, borders, and backgrounds.
- **Row and Column**: Used for horizontal and vertical alignment of children. These are the primary widgets for arranging multiple elements in a linear direction.
- **Stack**: Allows you to overlay widgets on top of each other. Useful for creating layered designs.

## Advanced Layout Widgets

- **Flex**: A widget that allows for a flexible layout model, distributing space among children based on a flex factor.
- **GridView**: A scrollable, 2D array of widgets. Ideal for creating grid-based layouts.
- **ListView**: A scrollable list of widgets, commonly used for displaying a large number of items in a single column.

## Alignment and Spacing

- **Align**: Aligns its child within itself according to an alignment.
- **Padding**: Adds empty space around a child widget.
- **Center**: Centers its child within itself.

## Responsive Design

- **MediaQuery**: Provides information about the size and orientation of the current screen, enabling you to create responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **LayoutBuilder**: Builds a widget tree that can depend on the parent widget's size constraints, allowing for dynamic layout adjustments.

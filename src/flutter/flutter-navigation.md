# Flutter Navigation

Flutter provides a robust and flexible navigation system to manage routes and screens within an application. The core component for navigation is the `Navigator` widget, which enables pushing and popping routes to manage the app's stack of screens.

## Basic Navigation

- **Pushing a Route**: Navigating to a new screen by adding a route to the stack.
- **Popping a Route**: Returning to the previous screen by removing the top route from the stack.

## Named Routes

- **Defining Routes**: Routes can be defined in the `MaterialApp` for cleaner and more maintainable navigation.
- **Navigating with Named Routes**: Use named routes for a more readable and organized navigation structure.
